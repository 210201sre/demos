# Project 0
Going to be an application. The specific features of this application is open for you to decide.

Some common examples are banking applications. Should allow users to sign up for an account. Should allow users to withdraw/deposit money from/into their account. Add additional features like transferring funds between accounts.

## Requirements
- Use `Javalin` to create a very small scale/simple web app.
    - Use `Postman` to send HTTP requests to the web app
- Use `JDBC` to store data in a PostgreSQL database
- Require the use of logging
    - Be able to calculate some interesting metrics about the application
    - How many users deposit funds into their account every day?
    - How many users deposit more than $1000 at least once per month?
    - How many requests does the application process per hour?
    - How long does it take to process a request on average?

## Notes

I will be teaching Javalin, how to use Postman and JDBC in the coming days. Along with this, I will also be showing general application structure that might help with overall organization for your application.

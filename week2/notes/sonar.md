# Code Quality Analysis

Sonar is a family of software that provides code quality metrics and analysis.

- SonarLint
    - A linter for your IDE to analyze code quality during development
- SonarCloud
    - A cloud-based service to track code quality metrics for 1 or more projects
        - Over time
    - Provides a nice dashboard/display for pre-prepared reports
- SonarQube
    - A server whose purpose is to track and manage code quality for many projects
    - Very similar to SonarCloud, except it's private, and not publically available
    - Also has potentially more features, as there is a paid version

These code quality analysis tools will become an integral part to our release pipelines.
Ties into DevOps.

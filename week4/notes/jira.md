# JIRA

JIRA is a project management tool. It has a kanban board, allows you to manage projects, and their epics, coordinate issues for different sprints, and has integrations with repositories on GitHub to automate some tasks.

For example, some of the integrations allow us to automatically move individual issues from "To Do" to "In Progress" to "In Review" automatically.
